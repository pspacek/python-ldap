LDAP module for Python
======================

This module provides access to the LDAP (C language) library.
It is known to compile and work with:
  * UM LDAP library v3.3, ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap.tar.Z
  * OpenLDAP release 1.2.11, http://www.openldap.org/

For extensive module usage documentation, look in the Doc directory.

Standard build instructions:
    sh configure
    make
    make install  (possibly)

Quick usage example:
    import _ldap
    l = _ldap.open("my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", _ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

Not included:
   Direct BER support
   CLDAP

   If you are looking for help, please use the same mailing list address.
   Be warned that questions will be ignored if they are deemed to be 
   trivially answered by referring to the documentation.

   We are really hoping that someone will add the CLDAP support and 
   possibly the OpenLDAP extensions such as display templates to this
   library. If you are interested in helping, please contact the mailing list.
   If you want new features or upgrades, please check the mailing list
   archives and then enquire about any progress.

Notes for Microsoft WIN32:
   You are now looking at the source distribution.  A precompiled ldap.pyd 
   for WIN32 architectures can also be found at:

   	http://www.csee.uq.edu.au/~leonard/dc-prj/ldapmodule/

   If you have MSVC6.0 or equivalent, and want to build the module yourself,
   you should refer to the README.txt file in the win32 directory.

Obtaining a C LDAP library (libldap.a)
   In many cases you will already have a C LDAP library installed (eg
   Solaris, Netscape or OpenLDAP libraries). You ought to run the configure
   script first to see if and which such libraries are found.

   If no C LDAP library is found, you should run the openldap.sh script
   found with this distribution. It will download and compile enough of
   a standard OpenLDAP library within a temporary area so that it
   can be statically linked into the Python ldapmodule. After the 
   ldapmodule has been created you can safely destroy the temporary area,
   even though no C LDAP library was installed in your system.
