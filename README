------------------------------
LDAP client API for Python
------------------------------

What is python-ldap?

python-ldap provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP
directory servers from Python programs. Mainly it wraps the
OpenLDAP 2.x libs for that purpose.

Additionally the package contains modules for other LDAP-related
stuff (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 sub-schema, etc.).

Not included: Direct BER support

See TODO for planned features. Contributors welcome.

It is known to compile and work with basic functionality with the
following versions:

  * Python 2.0+			<http://www.python.org/>
  * OpenLDAP 2.0.18		<http://www.openldap.org/>

Most parts should still work with Python 1.5.x. See compability notes
in module headers.

For module documentation, see:

	http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/

Quick build instructions:
    edit setup.cfg
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

Quick usage example:
    import ldap
    l = ldap.open("my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

See directory Demo/ of source distribution package for more
example code.
