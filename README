LDAP module for Python
======================

This module provides access to the LDAP (C language) library. It is 
known to compile and work with:

  * Python 2.0			<http://www.python.org/>
  * OpenLDAP 2.0.8		<http://www.openldap.org/>

For module documentation, see:

	http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/

Quick build instructions:
    edit setup.cfg
    make
    make install

Quick usage example:
    import _ldap
    l = _ldap.open("my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", _ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

Not included:
   Direct BER support
   CLDAP

   python-ldap-dev@lists.sourceforge.net

   If you are looking for help, please try the mailing list archives
   first, then send a question to the mailing list.
   Be warned that questions will be ignored if they can be
   trivially answered by referring to the documentation.

   We are really hoping that someone will add the CLDAP support and 
   possibly the OpenLDAP extensions such as display templates to this
   library. If you are interested in helping, please contact the mailing list.
   If you want new features or upgrades, please check the mailing list
   archives and then enquire about any progress.

Notes for Microsoft WIN32:
   This README is part of a source distribution.  A precompiled ldap.pyd 
   for WIN32 architectures can also be found at:

   	http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/

   If you have MSVC6.0 or equivalent, and want to build the module yourself,
   you should refer to the README.txt file in the win32/ directory.

Obtaining a C LDAP library
   See http://www.openldap.org/
   This release only supports compiling against OpenLDAP 2, although
   with some small effort it should compile against Netscape, UMich,
   Solaris, etc.  Check the mailing list and contact us if you want to
   see decent support continue for a particular library.

Copyright and licensing:
   Different parts of python-ldap have different licenses.  See 
   individual directories for their licensing. In brief, these are:
	_ldap:		public domain
	ldapthreadlock:	public domain
	ldif:		GPL
	win32:		unknown <public domain?>

   Although not a condition of the licenses, I strongly urge that any
   improvements you may make be sent back to us for inclusion into 
   future versions of this package (under the same free licensing).
