LDAP module for Python
======================

This module provides access to the LDAP (C language) library. It is 
known to compile and work with:

  * Python 2.0+			<http://www.python.org/>
  * OpenLDAP 2.0.18		<http://www.openldap.org/>

Most parts should still work with Python 1.5.x. See compability notes
in module headers.

For module documentation, see:

	http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/

Quick build instructions:
    edit setup.cfg
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

Quick usage example:
    import ldap
    l = ldap.open("my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

Not included:
   Direct BER support

Notes for Microsoft WIN32:
   This README is part of a source distribution.  A precompiled ldap.pyd 
   for WIN32 architectures can also be found at:

   	http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/

   If you have MSVC6.0 or equivalent, and want to build the module yourself,
   you should refer to the README.txt file in the win32/ directory.

Copyright and licensing:
   Different parts of python-ldap might have different licenses.  See
   individual directories for their licensing. In brief, these are:
	ldap:		public domain
	ldif:		public domain
	ldapurl:	public domain
	win32:		unknown <public domain?>

   Although not a condition of the licenses, I strongly urge that any
   improvements you may make be sent back to us for inclusion into 
   future versions of this package (under the same free licensing).
