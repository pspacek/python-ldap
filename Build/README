BUILD NOTES
-----------

This directory is for scripts helpful for building releases.

Some effort has been put into enabling build directories separate from
the source tree. This way, you can have one source tree and multiple
build directories. 

The general idea is to make a fresh build directory, cd there, then run 
the configure script in the source tree. Configure will notice this and
create Makefiles etc in the build directory.

In order to create packages after building, create a 'destdir' directory
and run a 'make install' with the DESTDIR variable set to the destdir
directory.
